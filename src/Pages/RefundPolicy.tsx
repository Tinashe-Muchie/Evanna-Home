            We have a 7-day return policy, which means you have 7 days after receiving your item to request a return.

            <p>
            To be eligible for a return, your item must be in the same condition that you received it, unused, with tags, and in its original packaging. You’ll also need the receipt or proof of purchase.

            <p>

            <h2>Refunds</h2>
            <p>
            We will notify you once we’ve received and inspected your return, and let you know if the refund was approved or not. If approved, you’ll be automatically refunded on your original payment method. Please remember it can take some time for your bank or credit card company to process and post the refund too.
